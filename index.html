      <h4>Week 2 Reading</h4>
    </h3>
      Carrión breaks down the fundamental elements and structures that compose a book and distinguishes different styles as "old" and "new art". Specifically, Carrión claims that old art prioritizes the intentions of the author, whereas new art allows readers with any kind of background and experiences to freely interpret the art however they like. I slightly disagree with how Carrión distinguishes these two styles of work as "old" and "new" as he seems to be implying that one style is anachronistic and strict while the other is more expressive and creative. Instead, I believe that both types of art/books are useful, and it really just depends on what the purpose of writing the book is (whether it is to inform, persuade, or question the readers).</p>

      <h4>Week 3 Reading</h4>
    </h3>
      For this week's reading, I have really enjoyed Schwulst's response in Essay 5 as I, myself, am I programmer who designs websites a lot. I have never really thought of websites as anything "unique"–at most, I would consider it a digital space/book for people to use for commercial, informational, or entertainment purposes. Especially for us college students, it would also be useful to have websites as a portfolio, showcasing ourselves and our passions. As I read through the different forms that websites can take on, I personally agree that a website is like a puddle as I would work on them whenever I have bursts of ideas and there is never a completeness to it as it keeps killing up with more information or changing with random design inspirations.

      <h4>Week 4 Reading</h4>
    </h3>
      This reading provoked me to think about the intersection and utilization of digital and print to further the limits of art. I have never really considered QR code as a bridge between print and digital media, and that got me thinking about other forms of technology like augmented reality where we use technology to literally bring and integrate art with life. In addition, it was interesting to see Ulises Carrión mentioned again and his opinion made me question the qualifications he has for hybrid art forms.

      <h4>Week 5 Reading</h4>
    </h3>
      When I read this excerpt, the first thing that caught my attention was the diagram that showed how signs are spread throughout each type of modernism and how it becomes exponential in the hypoerodernisation time. It is also really interesting how artists throughout history have used a "hyper" icon such as Mickey Mouse to draw out various political stand-points or to relay their message about something completely different from a happy mouse dancing it its red pants across to the global audience.

      <h4>Week 6 Reading</h4>
    </h3>
    Something that intrigues me about this reading and this class, in general, is that it encourages us to think of design in a multi-faceted way. In this particular reading, we are now looking at how design is used in various types of marketing for technology companies. Whether it would be to market AT&T's services back when communication and technology weren't as advanced or for Apple to design their logos and many more.

    One thing that also caught my attention was the experiment that Wertheimer did with the zoetrope as it reminded me of the strip of dog walking that a previous student did for their final project.

      <h4>Week 8 Reading</h4>
    </h3>
    Something that I kept thinking about while reading this article was how this is similar to the concept of captions on Instagram and how alt-texts are captions for those who may not have the same access to the visual components as we can. I think it is interesting as I am also taking another class in Software Engineering/Design right now and we also cover how to make our web/app products more inclusive for everyone. Reading the examples, I am also impressed by how descriptive they are as I instantly imagine in my head an image of the things they’re talking about.

      <h4>Week 10 Reading</h4>
    </h3>
    I find it interesting that the author was able to tie in the concepts of design to political and socioeconomic issues. The "Value" subtext interests me when she brings up the fact that designs gain value from the existence of rejection to other, opposite elements. Here, they compared new to old art and authentic to fake brand bags to show that without the latter to act as a foil, then the former would lose its value.

      <h4>Week 11 Reading</h4>
    </h3>
    I think this is a very interesting discussion as it could be linked to the unintentional bias we see not only in design but in different types of technology like machine learning/artificial intelligence research. As technology is advancing at such a fast pace, is there an abundance of researchers from diverse backgrounds that could also make this technology inclusive, accessible, and unbiased to all kinds of users? This is an especially interesting topic to me as I am an international student as well so I would love to see more inclusive/diverse technologies being available for users with different levels of knowledge on English, or more innovations surrounding other languages/cultures.</p>

      <h4>Week 13 Reading</h4>
    </h3>
    I find it interesting how the author talks about feeding social media feeds and live stream feeds as the modern form of boredom. People would randomly end up on certain streams and loiter there "out of boredom" and continue to watch the same things happening real-time while engaging in a continuous flow of conversation–sometimes even unrelated to the publication. I find this interesting as I find myself loitering in live streams and just reading the comments sometimes as well.</p>

      <h4>Week 14 Reading</h4>
    </h3>
    Even though I have never really heard of the term master-slave in class before, this reading makes me wonder whether just like how there is a master and a slave component in circuits; we are the slaves of the computers/technology in our lives as well. Our main character, Gem, reminds me of myself and a lot of other classmates/friends who become detached from society and their communities because they are too caught up with technology. It could be because of school work (like Gem) or just because of the control technology, social media, and the internet of things just have over all of our lives. This also resonates with how some of the content we have shown in this class could easily creep into something more unsettling due to the nature of how integrated technology is in our lives and how easily it could replicate physical matters into digital representations. Hence, I really like this reading as it is really applicable to the current generation and relays a good message of reconnecting with the analog world.

      <h4>Week 15 Reading</h4>
    </h3>
Even though I study computer science, I have never learned about the history of computers. I find it really interesting how "programming" transformed from having actual humans work as operators to switch things on large machines to having smaller devices where one person can just command chips and send binary signals of jut 0 and 1 for today's computers. The point about how gender plays a role in the history of programming during the World War was also really interesting. As STEM was historically dominated by males, it was interesting that people prefered woman programmers but it was also due to the different "clerical" nature of the commander-operator relationship of older machines.
